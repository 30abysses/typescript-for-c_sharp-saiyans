# Online Playground and `Hello, World!`

How do I try things out within a modern web browser (so I do not have to
install anything at all)?



# C#

By googling "C# online environment", you should find a few.  Here we
demonstrate how to run the `Hello World` example on Microsoft's official
.NET website.

1. Go to [https://www.microsoft.com/net/][1]
2. The middle section should be titled "Get started" with two text
   areas.
3. Populate the text area on the left with the `Hello World` example by
   selecting `Hello World` from the drop down list below the text area
   (if the text area is not already populated.)
4. Click the `Run` button below the text area.  The `Hello World`
   example will be executed, and its output should appear in the text
   area on the right.

## A C# `Hello, World!` Example

```
class C
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```



# TypeScript

1. Go to [https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/][2]
2. In the text area on the left, enter the `Hello, World!` example.
3. Click the `Run` button above the text area on the right.  The
   `Hello, World!` example will be executed, and its output should
   appear in a new web browser window.
